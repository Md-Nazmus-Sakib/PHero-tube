                        <p class="py-6">In JavaScript, users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that are var, let,
                            and const. We will see the differences between the var, let, and const keywords. We will
                            discuss the scope of that.</p>

                        <p class="py-6"><span class="font-bold text-2xl">JavaScript var keyword :</span>The var is the
                            oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript. The scope of the var keyword is the
                            global or function scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be accessed
                            globally, and variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the
                            function. </p>

                        <p class="py-6"><span class="font-bold text-2xl">JavaScript let keyword:</span>The let keyword
                            is an improved version of the var keyword. The scope of a let variable is only block scoped.
                            It can't be accessible outside the particular block ({block}). </p>

                        <p class="py-6"><span class="font-bold text-2xl">const keyword in JavaScript: </span>The const
                            keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword, except the user cannot
                            update it.
                            Block scoped When users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise, it
                            returns an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is declared.

                        <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold">2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
                        <p class="py-6">In JavaScript, there are two special types of values undefined and null. Null:
                            It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript.

                            Undefined: It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.
                            Simply put, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a
                            value. undefined is a type by itself (undefined). Unassigned variables are initialized by
                            JavaScript with a default value of undefined.</p>

                        <p class="py-6"><span class="font-bold text-2xl">1. Data types : </span>The data type of
                            undefined
                            is undefined whereas that of null is object. We can find the data types of both undefined
                            and null using the typeof operator.</p>

                        <p class="py-6"><span class="font-bold text-2xl">2. In arithmetic operations : </span>When used
                            in
                            arithmetic operations, undefined will result in NaN (not a number), whereas null will be
                            converted to 0 behind the screens.</p>

                        <p class="py-6"><span class="font-bold text-2xl">3. Undefined and null are falsy : </span>When
                            used in conditional logic both undefined and null will return false.
                        </p>

                        <p class="py-6"><span class="font-bold text-2xl">4. Comparing undefined and null : </span>As you
                            can see, when the equality operator is used it compares only the values. Both undefined and
                            null are falsy by default. So == returns true.

                            But when we use the strict equality operator (===) which checks both type and value, since
                            undefined and null are of different types (from the typeof Operator section), the strict
                            equality operator returns false.

                        <p class="py-6">An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how
                            applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API
                            that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer
                            architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.</p>

                        <p class="py-6">REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without
                            having any processing. REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple
                            Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST uses less bandwidth, simple and
                            flexible making it more suitable for internet usage. Itâ€™s used to fetch or give some
                            information from a web service. All communication done via REST API uses only HTTP request.
                        </p>
                        <p class="py-6">n HTTP there are five methods that are commonly used in a REST-based
                            Architecture i.e., POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read,
                            update, and delete (or CRUD) operations respectively. There are other methods which are less
                            frequently used like OPTIONS and HEAD.
                        </p>
